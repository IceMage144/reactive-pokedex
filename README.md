## Reactive Pokédex

This is a hiring challenge proposed by Intelie.

It consists of implementing a pokédex that:
* Uses the API http://pokeapi.co for getting the data
* Has a paginable list of pokémons
* Displays a detailed view of the pokémon when clicking at it

Build and run it with
```
npm run build
serve -s build
```
and access it through `localhost:5000`.
